## CVE-2023-33715

**Description**: 
Repeated controlled memory allocation in ACDSee Free v2.0.2.227 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) in the Host Machine

**Affected Product**:
ACDSee Free - 2.0.2.227

**Affected Component**:
ID_DCRaw.apl 4.15.1762.1 module (Used to process raw image filetypes)

**Impact**:
Denial of Service on Host Machine

**Location and Cause of the Bug**:

This sequential memory allocation occurs inside a loop at ID_DCRaw!IEP_GetDefaultEncodeParams+0x1060 in the function ID_DCRaw!IEP_GetDefaultEncodeParams+0xd80. 
The conditional check on the variable (ESI register) in the loop is controlled by the attacker and can be given any 32-bit arbitrary value leading to a large number of allocations leading to DOS eventually.
